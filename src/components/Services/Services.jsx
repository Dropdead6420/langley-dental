    <h1>General Dentistry</h1>

    <p>Maintaining optimal dental health is crucial for your overall well-being. At Richmond Shine Dental Clinic, we pride ourselves on offering exceptional general dentistry services designed for every age group. From routine check-ups to advanced treatments, our family dental care ensures you and your loved ones achieve healthy, beautiful smiles.</p>

    <h2>What Is General Dentistry?</h2>
    <p>General dentistry focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral health issues. A general dentist acts as your primary dental care provider, addressing common concerns and customizing treatments to your unique needs. Preventive care lies at its core, aiming to stop dental problems before they escalate into significant oral health issues.</p>

    <h2>General Dentistry Services Offered at Richmond Shine Dental Clinic</h2>
    <p>Richmond Shine Dental Clinic delivers comprehensive general dentistry services to maintain and restore your smile. Here’s an in-depth look at what we do:</p>

    <h3>Preventive Dental Care</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Routine Dental Check-ups:</strong> Our professional team recommends regular dental visits to monitor your oral health and detect potential problems early.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Cleanings:</strong> Even with excellent oral hygiene at home, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach areas. Dental cleanings help remove these buildups, lowering the risk of cavities and gum disease.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnostic Services</h3>
    <p>Accurate diagnosis is integral to effective treatment. Using advanced tools like X-rays and comprehensive oral examinations, we identify issues such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cavities</li>
      <li>Gum disease</li>
      <li>Structural damage</li>
      <li>Hidden infections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By catching problems early, Richmond Shine Dental Clinic ensures you avoid more invasive or costly procedures later.</p>

    <h3>Cavity Treatment (Fillings)</h3>
    <p>We offer tooth-colored composite fillings that seamlessly blend with your natural teeth while effectively restoring function.</p>

    <h3>Gum Disease Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Deep cleanings (scaling and root planing)</li>
      <li>Medication to control infection</li>
      <li>Maintenance programs to protect gum health</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Root Canal Therapy</h3>
    <p>When the dental pulp inside your tooth becomes infected or damaged, a root canal can save the tooth. This procedure removes the affected tissue, cleans the interior of the tooth, and seals it off to prevent further damage.</p>

    <h3>Tooth Extractions</h3>
    <p>We perform tooth extractions for severely decayed teeth, impacted wisdom teeth, or preparation for orthodontics, ensuring the procedure is as painless as possible.</p>

    <h3>Restorative Dentistry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dental Crowns:</strong> Custom-made crowns restore the strength of damaged teeth, preventing further wear or fractures.</li>
      <li><strong>Dental Bridges:</strong> Bridges are excellent solutions for replacing one or more missing teeth, restoring both functionality and aesthetics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Orthodontic Assessments</h3>
    <p>The alignment of your teeth plays a big role in your long-term oral health. Our general dentists provide orthodontic assessments, referring you to specialists for advanced care like braces or aligners when necessary.</p>

    <h3>Oral Health Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Proper brushing and flossing techniques</li>
      <li>Nutrition tips to maintain strong teeth and gums</li>
      <li>Habits to avoid (smoking, high-sugar diets, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This education empowers you to take charge of your dental health between appointments.</p>

    <h2>Dental Implants: A Permanent Solution for a Natural Smile</h2>
    <p>Dental implants are a revolutionary advancement in modern dentistry, offering a reliable and long-lasting way to restore both the function and aesthetics of your smile. These titanium posts are surgically placed into the jawbone, mimicking the natural tooth structure from root to crown. Not only do they provide a stable and secure fit, but they also stimulate the jawbone, preventing bone loss and maintaining facial structure over time.</p>

      <li><strong>Abutment Placement:</strong> A small connector (abutment) is attached to the implant to hold the replacement tooth.</li>
