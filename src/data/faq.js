  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "How do I choose between dental bonding and veneers?",
    "answer": "Choosing depends on your goals:\nBonding is great for minor fixes — small chips, small gaps, or slight discoloration.\nVeneers are better for more dramatic, long-lasting cosmetic changes — like changing tooth shape, covering deeper stains, or making a more uniform smile. Your dentist at Langley Care Dental will evaluate your oral health, budget, and aesthetic goals to recommend the best treatment."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How long will bonding or veneers last?",
    "answer": "Dental bonding typically lasts 5–10 years, depending on how well you care for it.\nPorcelain veneers are more durable and can last 10–15 years or more with proper oral hygiene."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Will my teeth feel different after veneers or bonding?",
    "answer": "There may be minor sensitivity for a short period:\nFor bonding, since no or very little enamel is removed, discomfort is usually minimal.\nFor veneers, a small amount of enamel is removed to make space, so temporary sensitivity to hot or cold is possible. Any sensitivity typically subsides in a few days."
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Can I whiten my teeth after getting bonding or veneers?",
    "answer": "No — most whitening treatments (bleaching) do not affect the color of composite resin or porcelain used in bonding/veneers.\nThis is why many patients choose their final shade during planning. If you plan to whiten, it's often better to do that before getting the restorations done."
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "question": "How do I maintain and care for my bonded or veneered teeth?",
    "answer": "To maximize longevity:\nBrush and floss regularly, just like natural teeth.\nAvoid biting very hard objects (ice, nails, etc.) to reduce risk of chipping.\nVisit Langley Care Dental for regular check-ups and cleanings — your dentist can monitor the condition and suggest touch-ups when needed."

    "answer": "Most pediatric dentists recommend that a child’s first dental appointment happen when the first tooth appears, or by their first birthday — whichever comes first."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How do I clean my baby’s teeth before they have many teeth?",
    "answer": "You can begin cleaning as soon as the first teeth erupt. Use a soft, infant-sized toothbrush (or a clean, damp washcloth) and gently wipe the gum surfaces."

  {
    "category": "Complete and Partial Dentures",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What’s the difference between a complete denture and a partial denture?",
    "answer": "A complete denture replaces all of the teeth in either the upper or lower jaw when no natural teeth remain. A partial denture fills in the gaps when some natural teeth are still present, anchoring to existing teeth with clasps or other mechanisms."

    "category": "Complete and Partial Dentures",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How do I clean and care for my dentures?",
    "answer": "Remove and rinse your dentures after eating to eliminate any food particles. Clean them daily with a soft-bristled brush and a non-abrasive denture cleanser. Soak the dentures overnight in water or a denture soaking solution to keep their shape and prevent drying out. Always rinse them thoroughly before putting them back in your mouth."
  },
  {
    "category": "Complete and Partial Dentures",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Can I sleep with my dentures in?",
    "answer": "It’s generally recommended to remove your dentures at night. Letting them rest and soaking them prevents drying, helps maintain their shape, and gives your gums a break. Removing them also allows for easier cleaning of both your dentures and your oral tissues."
  },
  {
    "category": "Complete and Partial Dentures",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Why do my dentures feel loose, and when should I see the dentist?",
    "answer": "Over time, changes in your jawbone and gums (due to ageing, weight loss, etc.) may cause your dentures to fit less securely. If your dentures feel loose, cause sore spots, or require denture adhesive daily just to stay in place, you should visit us. We can reline or adjust them for a better fit."
  },
  {
    "category": "Complete and Partial Dentures",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "How long will my dentures last? Do they need to be replaced?",
    "answer": "With proper care, dentures can last several years, but they are not permanent. The shape of your mouth changes over time, which can affect fit. Regular checkups are recommended so your dentist can assess if your dentures need to be relined, repaired, or replaced."

  },
  {
    "category": "Dental Emergencies",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "What if I lose a crown or filling?",
    "answer": "Save the crown or filling if you can, avoid chewing on that side, and call us to come in. Until your appointment, you can use a temporary dental cement or sugar-free gum to cover the exposed area."

  "digital-radiography": [
  {
    "category": "Digital Radiography",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "Is digital radiography safe?",
    "answer": "Yes — digital X-rays use significantly lower radiation than traditional film-based X-rays. Depending on the system, exposure can be as low as ~10% of what a film X-ray would deliver."
  },
  {
    "category": "Digital Radiography",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Why does Langley Care Dental use digital X-rays?",
    "answer": "We choose digital radiography because it provides clear, high-resolution images instantly, making diagnosis faster and more accurate."
  },
  {
    "category": "Digital Radiography",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How much radiation am I exposed to during a digital dental X-ray?",
    "answer": "The dose is very low — thanks to highly sensitive sensors, the radiation exposure can be reduced by up to 80–90% compared to conventional X-ray film."
  },
  {
    "category": "Digital Radiography",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Can digital radiographs be shared with other dentists or specialists?",
    "answer": "Yes — digital images can be stored electronically and easily shared, which helps in referrals, second opinions, or long-term monitoring."
  },
  {
    "category": "Digital Radiography",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Why are X-rays needed if I don’t feel any pain?",
    "answer": "Even without pain, X-rays help us detect hidden issues such as decay between teeth, early bone loss, or problems under the gumline. Digital radiography lets us spot these problems early so we can plan effective treatment."

  "invisalign": [
  {
    "category": "Invisalign Treatment",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "How does Invisalign work to straighten my teeth?",
    "answer": "Invisalign uses a series of custom-made, clear plastic aligners that apply gentle, controlled force to gradually shift your teeth. Each aligner in the sequence is slightly different, and when worn as prescribed, they move your teeth step-by-step toward the final alignment."
  },
  {
    "category": "Invisalign Treatment",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How long will my Invisalign treatment take?",
    "answer": "Treatment duration varies depending on your individual case — how complex your alignment issues are and how consistently you wear the aligners. On average, most patients complete Invisalign in 12 to 18 months, though you may begin noticing changes within just a few weeks."
  },
  {
    "category": "Invisalign Treatment",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How many hours a day should I wear my aligners?",
    "answer": "For optimal results, Invisalign aligners should be worn for 20 to 22 hours per day. You should only remove them for eating, drinking (anything other than water), brushing, and flossing."
  },
  {
    "category": "Invisalign Treatment",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Will Invisalign hurt or be uncomfortable?",
    "answer": "It’s normal to feel some pressure or mild discomfort when you start using a new set of aligners. This is a sign that your teeth are shifting as planned. The discomfort usually subsides within a couple of days."
  },
  {
    "category": "Invisalign Treatment",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Can I eat or drink anything while using Invisalign?",
    "answer": "Yes! One of the benefits of Invisalign is that the aligners are completely removable. You can take them out to eat any type of food — there are no dietary restrictions as with fixed braces. Just remember to remove the aligners before eating and brush your teeth (and the aligners) before putting them back in."

    "category": "Full Mouth Reconstruction",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is Full Mouth Reconstruction, and who needs it?",
    "answer": "Full Mouth Reconstruction (also called full mouth rehabilitation) is a comprehensive treatment process to rebuild or restore all of your teeth — combining both cosmetic and functional dentistry. It’s ideal for patients who have multiple dental issues such as worn-down teeth, missing teeth, decay, cracks, bite problems, or gum disease."
  },

  {
    "category": "Full Mouth Reconstruction",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How long does the full reconstruction process take?",
    "answer": "The timeline varies based on your individual needs. For complex cases (especially those involving implants), it may take 6 months to over a year. Smaller restorative work like crowns or veneers can be completed over a few visits."
  },
  {
    "category": "Full Mouth Reconstruction",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "What are the benefits of getting a full mouth reconstruction?",
    "answer": "Restores proper function: improves chewing, speaking, and bite.\n\nEnhances aesthetics: a natural, healthy-looking smile.\n\nImproves oral health by addressing decay, wear, and gum issues.\n\nMay relieve jaw pain or discomfort if bite problems are corrected."
  },
  {
    "category": "Full Mouth Reconstruction",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Will my dental insurance cover a full mouth reconstruction?",
    "answer": "Coverage depends on your insurance plan. Some restorative procedures (like crowns and root canals) may be partially covered, while more complex treatments (such as implants) may not be fully covered."

  "amalgam-removal-and-white-fillings": [
  {
    "category": "Amalgam Removal and White Fillings",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "Is it safe to remove old amalgam (mercury) fillings?",
    "answer": "Yes — when done properly, amalgam removal is safe. However, there can be a temporary increase in mercury vapor exposure during removal, so it’s important that your dentist uses special safety protocols (e.g., rubber dam, high-volume suction). The FDA itself notes that intact amalgam fillings should not be removed just for the sake of doing so unless there is decay or a medical reason."
  },
  {
    "category": "Amalgam Removal and White Fillings",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Why should I replace my amalgam filling with a white (composite) filling?",
    "answer": "There are several reasons: white fillings are metal-free, more aesthetic, and bond to your natural tooth structure, often requiring less enamel removal. If you have health concerns about mercury, or if the amalgam is old/cracked, replacing may be the right choice."
  },
  {
    "category": "Amalgam Removal and White Fillings",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "What are the risks of keeping amalgam fillings in my mouth?",
    "answer": "Amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor, especially when chewing or during removal. While levels are generally low, certain people (e.g., those with kidney issues, neurological conditions, pregnant women) may want to discuss alternatives. That said, scientific evidence does not strongly support systemic diseases caused by amalgam in healthy individuals."
  },
  {
    "category": "Amalgam Removal and White Fillings",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Are white (composite) fillings as durable as amalgam fillings?",
    "answer": "Composite (white) fillings have improved a lot in strength and durability. However, in high-stress areas (like big molars) amalgam may still be stronger, depending on the situation. White fillings can stain or wear over time, but they bond strongly to the tooth and preserve more natural tooth structure."
  },
  {
    "category": "Amalgam Removal and White Fillings",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "What precautions does Langley Care Dental take during amalgam removal?",
    "answer": "At Langley Care Dental, we ensure safe removal of amalgam using:\n- Rubber dam isolation to prevent swallowing or inhaling particles\n- High-volume suction to remove mercury vapors and debris\n- Proper protective measures for you and the dental team\n- Environmentally responsible disposal of removed amalgam material"

    "category": "Cosmetic Dentistry",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Is cosmetic dentistry just for looks — will it benefit my oral health too?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Cosmetic Dentistry",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How long do cosmetic results last?",
    "answer": "It depends on the treatment:\n- Teeth whitening can last from several months to a year, depending on diet and oral care.\n- Veneers typically last 10–20 years, or even longer, with good oral hygiene and regular check-ups.\n- Bonding’s lifespan also depends on your habits and maintenance."

    "category": "Cosmetic Dentistry",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Does insurance cover cosmetic dentistry?",

  {
    "category": "Botox Treatment",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What conditions can Botox help with in a dental setting?",
    "answer": "Botox can be used therapeutically in dentistry to relieve symptoms associated with TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorders, bruxism (teeth grinding and jaw clenching), and even help with a “gummy smile” or lower facial muscle tension."
  },
  {
    "category": "Botox Treatment",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How does Botox work to reduce jaw pain and grinding?",
    "answer": "When injected into overactive jaw muscles (such as the masseter or temporalis), Botox temporarily relaxes them by blocking nerve signals. This reduces muscle tension, alleviates pain, and decreases the force of teeth grinding over time."
  },
  {
    "category": "Botox Treatment",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How long do the effects of Botox last for TMJ or bruxism treatment?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Botox Treatment",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "Is Botox covered by insurance for TMJ or bruxism?",

    "category": "Crowns and Bridges",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the difference between a dental crown and a bridge?",
    "answer": "A crown (or “cap”) is a restoration that covers a damaged or weakened tooth to strengthen it and restore its shape. A bridge, on the other hand, replaces one or more missing teeth: it uses crowns on the adjacent teeth to anchor a false tooth (or “pontic”) in the gap."
  },
  {
    "category": "Crowns and Bridges",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "What materials are used for crowns and bridges, and which is best for me?",
    "answer": "Crowns and bridges can be made from a variety of materials—such as porcelain fused to metal (PFM), full porcelain, zirconia, or other high-strength ceramics. Porcelain / ceramic offers excellent aesthetics and blends well with natural teeth. Zirconia is very strong and durable. The “best” material depends on where the restoration is (front vs back), your bite, and aesthetic goals."

    "category": "Crowns and Bridges",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How long do crowns and bridges last?",

    "category": "Crowns and Bridges",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Do I need to avoid certain foods after getting a crown or bridge?",
    "answer": "While modern crowns and bridges are quite strong, it's wise to avoid very hard or crunchy foods (like hard candy, nuts, ice) that may stress the restoration or underlying tooth. Gentle chewing and avoiding habits like biting nails or opening packaging with teeth will help protect your restoration."
  },
  {
    "category": "Crowns and Bridges",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "How should I care for my crowns and bridges?",
    "answer": "Continue brushing twice daily and flossing — even though crowns/bridges themselves don’t decay, the underlying natural tooth and gums still do. Use floss threaders or special interdental brushes to clean under a bridge. Attend regular dental cleanings so your dentist or hygienist can check the condition of your crown or bridge and make minor adjustments if needed."

    "category": "Root Canal Treatment",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "Is a root canal painful?",
    "answer": "Not usually — modern root canal treatment is performed under local anesthesia, so most patients feel little to no pain during the procedure. After treatment, you might experience mild discomfort for a few days, which can typically be managed with over-the-counter pain relief."
  },
  {
    "category": "Root Canal Treatment",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Why do I need a root canal?",
    "answer": "A root canal becomes necessary when the pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth) is infected or damaged due to deep decay, cracks, or repeated dental work. The procedure removes the infection, cleans out the canals, and seals the tooth to prevent further issues."
  },
  {
    "category": "Root Canal Treatment",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How long does a root canal treatment take, and how many visits are needed?",
    "answer": "Treatment time depends on the complexity of the case. Sometimes a root canal can be completed in one visit (often 60-90 minutes), but in more complex or infected cases, it may require two visits or more."
  },

    "category": "Root Canal Treatment",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Will the treated tooth be weaker after a root canal?",
    "answer": "After a root canal, the inner nerve is removed, but the tooth is sealed and often restored with a crown to protect it. With this restoration, the tooth can remain strong and functional for many years."
  },
  {
    "category": "Root Canal Treatment",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "What are the risks or possible complications?",
    "answer": "As with any dental procedure, there are some risks. These can include persistent infection, breakage of the instrument, or failure of the seal. In rare cases, retreatment or extraction may be needed."

    "category": "Teeth Whitening",
    "id": 1,
    "question": "Is teeth whitening safe for my teeth?",
    "answer": "Yes — professional teeth whitening performed under the supervision of a dentist is considered safe. Modern whitening agents are designed to remove stains without damaging your enamel. If you have sensitive teeth, we can adjust the strength or method to reduce discomfort."
  },
  {
    "category": "Teeth Whitening",
    "id": 2,
    "question": "How long will the whitening results last?",
    "answer": "The duration of the whitening effect can vary. On average, results can last several months to a year, depending on lifestyle factors like your diet, oral hygiene, and whether you smoke. We also offer touch-up options (like take-home trays) to help maintain your brighter shade."
  },
  {
    "category": "Teeth Whitening",
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Will teeth whitening work on my crowns, fillings, or veneers?",
    "answer": "No — whitening only affects natural tooth enamel. Restorations such as crowns, veneers, and fillings do not change color with whitening, so your dentist may recommend replacing them afterward to match the new shade."
  },
  {
    "category": "Teeth Whitening",
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Can teeth whitening cause sensitivity or gum irritation?",
    "answer": "It’s common to experience mild sensitivity or slight gum irritation during or after treatment. These effects are usually temporary and fade within a few days. If needed, we can use desensitizing techniques or products to make the procedure more comfortable."
  },
  {
    "category": "Teeth Whitening",
    "id": 5,
    "question": "How do I maintain my whitened teeth?",
    "answer": "To prolong your whitening results: Practice good oral hygiene: brush twice daily and floss regularly. Avoid or limit stain-causing foods/drinks (like coffee, red wine, tea) and smoking. Use a straw for staining beverages when you can. Attend regular dental cleanings and consider periodic whitening touch-ups."
